# Dockerimages
This repo purposes is to create/dockerize application into docker image. I'll add different type application to be dockerize from time to time

## Reason
The reason why I do this is to easily refresh the docker , kubernetes stuff when haven't touch them for a long time.
Hopefully, this can help people out there to refresh their mind about docker
